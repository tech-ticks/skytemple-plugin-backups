# SkyTemple Example Plugin
This is an example plugin for [SkyTemple](https://skytemple.org).

To install this with a regular SkyTemple Python-based installation
("development setup"), just install this via `pip`. 
It will then load automatically. This also works in editable mode.

To install this with the SkyTemple Flatpak or Mac/Windows distributions,
see our [wiki](https://wiki.skytemple.org/index.php/Plugin).

## What this plugin does
This plugin adds a new `Pokémon Spawns` entry to the item tree
that has an entry for each Pokémon to edit their spawns on every
dungeon floor.

## How to write your own plugin
